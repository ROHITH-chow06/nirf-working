    Extracts student gender ratio data from a specific table in a NIRF PDF.

    This function opens a PDF, finds the college name and ID, then looks for the
    'Total Actual Student Strength' table. It extracts program names, total students,
    and female students, calculates the female ratio, and returns a pandas DataFrame.

    Returns:
        A pandas DataFrame with the extracted student ratio data. Returns an empty
